    "Want to understand the full experimental design? Here's the process, we apologize in advance.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Part 1: Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the final data processing for identifying \"valid observations\" that can be used in the final regression analysis. A \"valid observation\" is defined as a *collection of posts* from a single profile that matches the required pattern for either a control observation or a treatment observation. The following definitions wil be used throughout the notebook and are the basis for this causal experimental design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Viral Post**: A single post whose (square root transformed) engagement exceeds 3 standard deviations from the profile mean engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline**: A series of `w`consecutive posts where the (square root transformed) engagement for every post falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean. A baseline is expected to represent a level of consistent engagement for the profile's posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Window (`w`)**: Required number of consecutive posts to define a valid \"baseline\". The window is varied between 5 and 40 posts to perform a sensitivity analysis on the consistency of the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Treatment Observation**: A treatment observation is represented as the combination of a single (or many) viral posts surrounded by a baseline before and after the instance(s) of virality. Data from each baseline before and after the viral post will be submitted as individual post data to the regression analysis. For example, if the window `n` is equal to 20 posts, a \"valid treatment observation\" with a single viral post between baselines would submit 41 samples of data to the regression. However, in total, all 41 samples would be evaluating the effect of a single observation of virality. Hence, we call it a single treatment observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Observation**: If we define a treatment observation to be virality samdwiched between two baselines, we define a the pattern for control observations to be no viral posts sandwiched between two baselines. In other words, two consecutive baselines stitched together for a total baseline length of `2*n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the chances of observing seasonality effects for a particular profile (say a brand known for summer-time clothing that only experiences virality during the summer and only experiences control observations during winter), treatment observations and control observations are taken from pairs of companies matched based on followers, engagement levels, and other profile-level evaluation metrics. By splitting companies into treatment and control, we also prevent potential data leakage from residual effects of treatment data found in control (or vice versa). Company matching is explained in another notebook. At this point we are provided a list of 10 matched control and treatment profiles from which we'll search for valid control and treatment observations.\n",

    "#### **Part 2: Extracting Control and Treatment Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to search each of the treatment profile engagement data and find valid instances of \"baseline-viral-baseline\" patterns for each of the respective window sizes `w`. For this explanation we'll use window_size of `20 posts`. The high level process and associated functions are described below.\n",

    ">    - find_virality()\n",
    "\n",
    ">3. Find valid pairs of baselines (pre- and post- baseline with a gap in between). Overlapping data is not permitted - each instance of virality must have a unique pre and post baseline. Therefore, for treatment, the first and last identified baseline for a particular profile can be `w=20` posts in length, but any baseline in the middle must be twice as long to adequately represent a *post-baseline* for the previous virality and a *pre-baseline* for the subsequent virality. To maintain consistency between measuring baselines for treatment and control, the baselines are limited to window size `w=20` posts. Therefore, if a profile starts the year with 100 consecutive posts at baseline levels before a viral post, the pre-baseline data will include only the last `w=20` posts before virality. This enables the \"control observation\" (of length `2*w`) to have the same size pre-baseline and post-baseline as the treatment observations.\n",

    ">    - find_treatment_baselines()\n",

    ">4. For each pair of pre- and post- baselines, evaluate whether there is (are) any viral post(s) between the pairs of pre- and post- baselines. If there is at least one viral post, store the indices for pre-baseline, post-baseline, and number of viral posts as a single treatment observation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    Functions:\n",
    ">    - find_valid_treatment_obs()\n",
    "\n",
    ">5. Using the indices stored for the starts and ends of the treatment observation baselines, extract these rows of data (individual posts) from the main dataset and tag them with binary indicator for before or after virality `Time_frame = 0/1` along with the variable number of viral posts associated with the baselines `Treatment = V`. By using the number of viral posts between baselines, we quantify the treatment intensity and derive a *per-viral-post* treatment effect from the eventual interaction term coefficient between `Time_Frame` and `Treatment`.\n",

    ">    Functions:\n",
    ">    - extract_observations()\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated for identifying the control observations, but instead of searching for isolated baselines with unique strings of `w=20` posts, we search for consecutive baselines of `2w=40` posts, then split the singular baseline into a simulated *pre-baseline* and *post-baseline* both of length `w=20` posts. These control observations will control for time-based natural fluctuations in engagement and represent \"a world without virality\" for the match paired treatment company. Similar to before, the time frame is set to `Time_Frame = 0/1` and the Treatment is set to `Treatment = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have two dataframes: Treatment DataFrame and Control DataFrame - observations extracted from their respective treatment/control matched company pairs."

    "Because we chose to match companies together into control and treatment groups, we end up with different quantities of treatment and control observations.

In order to fix this discrepancy, we need to match again, but this time match treatment observations directly to control observations within the matched company pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptively, this means we can only use the minimum number of observations found between the control and treatment company of each matched pair. By doing this, we ensure the same number of total control and treatment observations for the regression and we ensure the control group and treatment group have the same distribution of company type/size representation. \n",
